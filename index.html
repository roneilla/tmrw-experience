          <p>Through a process of iteration and continual building of a range of experiences, our team created an interactive trans-media experience focused on the stages of grief, friendship, and family dynamics.</p>

                     <blockquote> <p><b>The challenge: </b>transform a greek myth (Hades and Persephone) into a trans-media interactive experience, based on a reimagining of the key narrative elements into a new story.</p></blockquote>
<p>Through several iterations, we drafted a narrative focused on this story line which we took forward into the planning and development phases of the process.</p>

<p>We also more clearly defined the characters and their traits, which determined how they would act at different points in their own individual storylines:</p>

<h2 class="post-title">
  Developing the experience            </h2>
  <p>Once we had more clearly defined the characters and the narrative we wanted to tell, we started to determine how to tell the story through different platforms (types of experiences)</p>
  <p>Throughout the project process, we used this platform chart to guide the narrative and timing for each of our digital and physical deliverables that we were launching.</p>
  <p>This platform map evolved throughout the project, as we tested out different tools and found out what did and didn't work.</p>
  <p>One of these included AR.js as we had originally hoped to create a marker-less experience, but the dev time and additional requirements for the user meant that this option didn't make sense for this project.</p>
 
 <p>For all of the platforms, we continually iterated, tested, and got feedback as we worked, which helped us pivot as needed, and refine the platforms to better match the narrative we were aiming to convey.</p>
 
 <h2 class="post-title">
  Results        </h2>
 <p>At the end of this process, we were able to successfully build and soft launch these deliverables.</p>
  <p>Under different circumstances, it would have been ideal to user test these deliverables to determine if some of these issues might have been caused by VR or other platforms' UX design, versus issues with confusing content, and speak with users about their impressions of the experience. </p>
 <p>We also would have been able to test rabbit holes (ways to go deeper in the experience) and entry points to see if users understood what actions to take, and iterate from there.</p>
 <p>Overall, the project was successful in that we created deliverables that carry the narrative and visual style through a consistent user journey. The main area that we would improve in the future would be more side plots and secondary character development, as most of our platforms served as supplements to the main narrative.</p>
 <h2 class="post-title">
  Learnings & reflection      </h2>
 <p>Despite everyone in our group carrying out different project functions, we all had several overlapping learnings from the process of creating a trans-media experience.</p>
 <h3>Some of these areas of learning and growth included:</h3>
 <ol>
<li>Managing a large project with a lot of moving parts: including project management strategies and ways of collaborating remotely to sustain our momentum</li>
<li>How to design a cohesive experience across multiple touchpoints and types of experiences</li>
<li>Better work across content, development, and design processes simultaneously, to work most efficiently to build each platform</li>
 </ol>
 <p>Overall, working on this project gave us the opportunity to take something from concept through to fully developing it, and managing the process and deliverables over a timeline. With a project this complex, it really allowed us to learn not only design and development processes, but ways to better communicate and time and project manage so that this team effort could be successful.</p>
